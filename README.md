# Learn Bivvy
Learn Bivvy is an app that allows users to manage demo videos for their newest customers. It is designed for a local startup in the GIS industry.

There is a 'backend' where the startup admin can log in and create new 'lessons' for their customer depending on which service industry they are in. The videos come from demo videos on created on Youtube. The 'frontend' allows the startup admin to send a customized URL (by service-industry) to the new customer.
